# RiboswitchClassification

[riboflow](https://test.pypi.org/project/riboflow/) is a python package for classifying putative riboswitch sequences into one of 24 classes with > 99% accuracy. It is based on a [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) deep learning model. ``riboflow`` has been tested using ``Python 3.5.2``. 

Datasets, Models
------------

1.original_datasets

    a. 24_riboswitches_fasta    --> Fasta   Format of the 24 riboswitches
    b. 24_riboswitches_new_csv  --> CSV     Format of the 24 riboswitches
    
2.processed_datasets

    a. final.csv                --> Original 24 riboswitches Dataset cleaned and Frequencies calculated
    b. final_train.csv          --> 90% of each riboswitches label in the final.csv
    c. final_test.csv           --> Remaining 10% of each riboswitches label in the final.csv
    
3.pickled_models

    Contains all the trained sklearn models (generated by RocAucAllBaselineModels.py) saved in pkl format
    
4.models

    Contains the rnn and cnn model's saved in h5 format 
    


Baseline Models Constructed using Sklearn Library
------------

    > python3  RocAucAllBaselineModels.py
    
    1. Create's a Picked Model for each of the sklearn classifers stated below:
        AdaBoostClassifier(),
        GaussianNB(),
        KNeighborsClassifier(),
        DecisionTreeClassifier(),
        RandomForestClassifier(),
        MLPClassifier()
    2. Each model is used on the test set to obtain accuracy, generate a classication report and the ROC-AUC values for each 
       of the 24 classes. 
    3. The MLPClassifier() proved to be the best among the chosen sklearn classifiers and hence Neural Networks (CNN and RNN) 
       were explored further to acheive greater accuracy.
